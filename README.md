# Menu-Driven Student Management System

## Description

This Java program implements a menu-driven student management system to demonstrate the concepts of classes, arrays of objects, instance members, and constructors. It simulates core functionalities like:

* Adding students: Collects and stores student details (PRN, name, DoB, marks) in a dynamic array of `Student` objects.
* Displaying students: Iterates through the array and presents each student's information in a clear format.
* Searching by PRN, name, or position: Provides three search options:
    * By PRN: Finds a student based on their unique PRN number.
    * By name: Searches for students matching a given name (case-insensitive).
    * By position: Retrieves the student details at a specific index in the array.
* Updating/editing student information: Allows modification of any student's marks upon entering their PRN.
* Deleting students: Permanently removes a student from the array based on their PRN.
